## 👋 About Me

I’m a **PhD student in Artificial Intelligence**, specializing in **3D vision, signal processing, and multimodal learning**.  
I graduated from **ENSEIRB-MATMECA** (*National Graduate School of Electronics, Computer Science, Telecommunications, Mathematics and Mechanics of Bordeaux*) in 2025, where I followed the **Telecommunications track** with a focus on *Image, Signal, and Communications*.  
In parallel, I earned a **Master’s degree in ISIS** (*Engineering of Systems for Image and Signal*) at the **University of Bordeaux**.

During my studies, I was part of an *Engineer-PhD track* in **AI for semi-supervised semantic segmentation**, which naturally led to my current doctoral research.

## 🎓 PhD Research

I’m currently pursuing my PhD at the **CEA** (*French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission*), in collaboration with the **IMS Laboratory** (*Integration of Material to Systems*), a joint research unit of the **CNRS** (*National Centre for Scientific Research*), **University of Bordeaux**, and **Bordeaux INP**.

My research focuses on:  
> **Machine Learning for segmentation and object detection through multimodal fusion of point clouds and images.**

This work explores how **LiDAR point clouds**, which provide accurate 3D geometry but limited sampling density and visibility, can be **fused with camera images** that offer rich texture and color information.  
By combining both modalities, the goal is to achieve the **best of both worlds** — spatial precision from LiDAR and visual richness from RGB data — for improved 3D scene understanding.
